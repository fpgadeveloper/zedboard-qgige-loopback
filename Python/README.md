Python 3.3 32bit
================

This folder contains the Python code for this project.

### How to build an Eclipse workspace from these sources

This code was developed using Eclipse SDK and PyDev for Eclipse. If you
wish to develop the code in Eclipse, you must first install Eclipse and
PyDev, then follow the instructions below:

1. Run Eclipse.
2. Select this folder as the workspace to use (the folder that contains
   this readme file).
3. Eclipse will run with a Welcome window. Close the Welcome window.
4. Select Window->Preferences.
5. Select PyDev->Interpreter-Python.
6. Click New, a window will open that allows you to select the interpreter.
7. As Interpreter Name, type: python33
   You could use any name you wish, but using the name "python33", you will
   not have problems when we Import the Eclipse project.
8. Click Browse and navigate to your Python interpreter executable. It is
   usually in a folder such as "C:\Python33\python.exe".
9. Click OK, and OK again in the preferences window.
10. Select Window->Open Perspective->PyDev. If PyDev is not listed, click
    Window->Open Perspective->Other, then you should see a list that
    includes PyDev.
11. Select File->Import.
12. Select General->Existing Projects into Workspace and click Next.
13. Click Browse and select this directory as the "root directory".
14. You should see the Python project(s) you need in the Projects list.
    They should all be ticked by default, but if not, tick them and
    click Finish.
15. You should now see the projects listed in the PyDev Package Explorer
    on the left side of the Eclipse window. Now you're ready to develop!
